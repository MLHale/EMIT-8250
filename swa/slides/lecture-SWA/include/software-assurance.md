As we explore this course topic, it helps to know about recent day software failures. Each one of these send organizations scrambling for testing and applying patches in their environments.

2014 Sandworm used a zero day exploit in all version of Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability exists in PACKAGER.DLL, which is a part of Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) property. By using a crafted PowerPoint document, an .INF file in embedded OLE object can be copied from a remote SMB share folder and installed on the system. Attackers can exploit this logic defect to execute another malware, downloaded via the same means.

2014 Heartbleed in the OpenSSL library was really a wake-up call for organizations using poor management practices for software acquisition and inventory. Many organizations started paying attention to open source software risk management after this incident. This bug involved a buffer length check issue that allowed an attacker to read all memory contents including SSL\TLS keys used for encryption. At the time, none of the open source or proprietary static or dynamic analysis tools
could discover this vulnerability.

# Shellshock or Bashdoor
A issue in the bash shell that allowed arbitrary commands to be executed when the commands are concatenated to the end of function definitions stored in the values of environment variables. Within days of the publication of this, intense scrutiny of the underlying design flaws discovered a variety of related vulnerabilities, (CVE-2014-6277, CVE-2014-6278, CVE-2014-7169, CVE-2014-7186, and CVE-2014-7187).

The GHOST vulnerability is a serious weakness in the Linux glibc library. It allows attackers to remotely take complete control of the victim system without having any prior knowledge of system credentials. CVE-2015-0235 has been assigned to this issue. The flaw existed in a DNS client-side resolver in glibc, and was exploitable through the use of a particular function called getaddrinfo(). It allowed attackers to use DNS servers or domains in their control to essentially takeover systems and applications running the flawed software. All major Linux distributions and the glibc project have issued patches for the problem.

# Apple SSL/TLS bug
Two goto fail lines in a row. The first one is correctly bound to the if statement but the second, despite the indentation, isn't conditional at all. The code will always jump to the end from that second goto, err will contain a successful value because the SHA1 update operation was successful and so the signature verification will never fail.

Meltdown and Spectre exploit critical vulnerabilities in modern processors. These hardware vulnerabilities allow programs to steal data which is currently processed on the computer. While programs are typically not permitted to read data from other programs, a malicious program can exploit Meltdown and Spectre to get hold of secrets stored in the memory of other running programs. This might include your passwords stored in a password manager or browser, your personal photos, emails, instant messages and even business-critical documents.

.footnote[

???
This is an interesting observation. The security community is too busy dealing with fixing things from outside and dealing with the problem after it already is a serious problem. The predictions are almost about the things that the vendors can solve and can currently address. The latter part is the hard problem.

The software engineering community is too busy inventing solutions to build more and more complex pieces of software faster and cheaper.

Story time:  
[Source: http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2009/6/28488-answering-the-wrong-questions-is-no-answer/fulltext]  
Two buddies leaving a tavern find a distressed and somewhat inebriated man on his hands and knees in the parking  lot, apparently searching for something.
They ask him what he has lost, and he replies that he has dropped his keys. He describes the keys, and says if the two men find them they will receive a
reward. They begin to help search. Other people come by and they too are drawn into the search. Soon, there is a crowd combing the lot, with an air of competition
to see who will be the first to find the keys. Periodically someone informs the crowd of the discovery of a coin or a particularly interesting piece of rock.
After a while, one in the crowd stands up and inquires of the fellow who lost his keys, “Say, are you sure you lost your keys out here in the lot?” To which the
man replies, “No. I lost them in the alley.”  Everyone stops to stare at the man. “Well, why the heck are you searching
for them here in the parking lot!?” someone exclaimed. To which the man replied, “Well, the light is so much better
here. And besides, now I have such good company!”

if we don’t properly define the problem, ask the right questions, and search in the proper places, they may have
good company and funding, but they shouldn’t expect to find what they are really seeking.

So it is in research—especially in cyber security and privacy. We have people seeking answers to the wrong
questions, often because that is where “the light is better” and there seems to be a bigger crowd around them. Until
we start asking questions that better address the problems that really need to be solved, we shouldn’t expect to
see progress. Here are a few examples of misleading questions:

* How do I secure my general purpose software against all threats?

* How do I protect my system with an intrusion-detection system, data
loss and prevention tools, firewalls, and other techniques?

* How do I find coding flaws in the system I am using so I can patch them?

Each of these questions implies it can be answered in a positive, meaningful way.
That is not necessarily the case.
We have generally failed to understand that when we build and deploy
systems they are used in a variety of environments, facing different threats.
There is no perfect security in any real system—hardware fails, people make
mistakes, and attacks outside our expectations may defeat our protection
mechanisms. If an attacker is sufficiently motivated and has enough resources
(including time), every system can be defeated in some manner.
If the attacker doesn’t care if the defeat is noticed, it may reduce the work factor
involved; as an obvious example, an assured denial-of-service attack can
be accomplished with enough nuclear weapons.

The goal in the practice of security is to construct sufficient defenses against the likely threats

# What is Software Assurance?

# [NASA Definition](https://sma.nasa.gov/sma-disciplines/software-assurance)
## The planned and systematic set of activities that ensures that .red[software processes and products] conform to requirements, standards, and procedures.
.red[Processes]: include all of the activities involved in designing, developing, enhancing, and maintaining software    

.red[Products]: include the software, associated data, its documentation, and all supporting and reporting paperwork

* The theme is organizational in nature and emphasizes a well thought-out set of activities to achieve compliance with organizational best practices, requirements standards and procedures.
* Process (a complete cradle to grave  approach for the software lifecycle)
* Products (this amounts to all the software artifacts produced
* NASA stays away from the word security because both security and safety are covered under the umbrella of their software assurance effort and goal is correctness !

# Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS)
## The level of confidence that .red[software] is free from .red[_vulnerabilities_], regardless of whether they are .red[intentionally] designed into the software or accidentally inserted later in its life cycle, and that the software functions in the intended manner.
???
- This understanding of software assurance is consistent with the use of the term in connection with information, i.e., information assurance (IA).
- A more technical definition which focuses on software flaws, intention, and time of introduction.  
- __lost the focus on engineering!__

NSA Center for Assured Software was stood up in 2005
* They focus on **exploitable** vulnerabilities only. Much more refined scope.
* NSA does not develop software, they only test it. So no emphasis on engineering here as well.

* Design analysis, however, is done before any code analysis.
* The "n+1" vulnerability problem. You will never be able to hire enough blackhat hackers, if the foundational design and engineering effort is missing.

Application of .green[technologies and processes] to achieve a required level of .blue[confidence\*] that software systems and .red[services] function in the intended manner, are free from accidental or intentional vulnerabilities, provide .red[security capabilities appropriate to the threat environment], and .red[recover from intrusions and failures].

## .red[Basis for the belief] that software will operate as expected in its .red[threat environment]

.red[Contain] the damage and recover to a normal level of operation as soon as possible for attacks that cannot be tolerated  
???
Highlights:
* This claim is complex enough that we cannot possibly examine every circumstance related to it.
* The focus of the definition is on Assurance: Providing the _Basis for the Belief_ in situations when it is impossible to examine all circumstances related to the threat environment
* Software behavior is tied to it threat environment (avoid making general statements about secure software)
* Account for known attacks
* Acknowledge unknown attacks and plan for them.
* Recover from failures --> This is "resiliency"
# This is an outcome of Software Security Engineering

* Question: So when are attacks successful?
